Hi there!

Welcome to my new blog. Thank you for wasting your time reading me, I mean, I'm pretty sure there's a new Netflix documental that you haven't seen way more interesting than reading what an average human being from Spain could write. So thank you for reading üòä.  

I made it entirely with [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish), a great tool to make websites with Swift, by my buddy [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/JohnSundell).

This is my 3rd or 4th attempt at trying to start a blog. I hope to be more consistent and write often. The good thing is that this is the first time I make a blog by myself, on my domain (years ago I used Blogger and Medium). 

I'm not completely sure if this is going to be a purely technical blog or I'm going to write about other things, I'll figure it out while driving. Anyway, for now, the topics will be mostly technical, I'm exploring SwiftUI so I think that's what I'm going to start with.

If you want to know how to make your website with [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish), 2 articles helped me to get started:

- [Getting started with publish](https://blog.bitomule.com/posts/getting-started-with-publish/) by my friend [David Collado](https://twitter.com/Bitomule).
- [Migrating from Jekyll to Publish: A site generator for Swift developers](https://www.staskus.io/posts/2020-01-26-publish/) by [Povilas Staskus](https://twitter.com/PovilasStaskus).

If you've reached this point chances are that you've completed Netflix and you do not have anything else to do, so here's a recommendation: go watch [Objectified](https://documentaryheaven.com/objectified/) if you haven't yet. A great documentary on design and our relationships with products.

Cheers ‚úåÔ∏è.
