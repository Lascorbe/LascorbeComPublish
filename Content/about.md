title: About Me
---

I'm Luis Ascorbe, **a software developer living in Barcelona with over 8 years of experience on Apple platforms development (iOS/macOS/watchOS/tvOS)**. I quit my job as iOS Lead at Wallapop at the end of 2019. After a few months of sabbatical, I'm looking for a new opportunity, so if your company is hiring ping me!

In my free time, I learn about people and project management, design, and new things in programming. Now I'm exploring SwiftUI and what can be achieved with it. 

I also **run a worldwide developers conference called [NSSpain](http://nsspain.com)** about programming for Apple platforms in Logro√±o, a small and beautiful city in the countryside of Spain:
